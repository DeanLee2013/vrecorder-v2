# Feature Tracker

Track features to be implemented here. Must be planned before implementation.

## Rules

> **Binding for this file.** The rules, statuses, and plan template below govern every change made to `docs/features.md`. AGENTS.md treats them as the authoritative feature-tracker workflow.

- **Bugs vs features**: If something was implemented but doesn't work correctly, it is a **bug** — track it in `docs/bugs.md`. If something was never implemented, it is a **feature** — track it here. Never mix them.
- **Partial implementations**: If something is partially implemented, the broken part is a bug in `docs/bugs.md`; the missing capability is a feature here. Link them.
- **Cross-links**: When a bug fix resolves a feature, update the feature status to `DONE` with note `Resolved by bug #N`. When a feature depends on a bug fix, use `TODO` status with note `Blocked by bug #N`.
- **Plan before implementation**: Every feature must be planned before any code is written. Status must reach `PLANNED` before moving to `IN PROGRESS`. A plan requires the fields listed in the "Plan Template" section below.
- **Exception — resolved by bug fix**: If a bug fix incidentally delivers a feature, the feature may be set to `DONE` with `Resolved by bug #N` without a full plan.

## How to use

1. Add features as you identify them (fill in Summary and Area at minimum)
2. Plan the feature (fill in required plan fields) → set status to `PLANNED`
3. Tell the agent: "implement feature #N" to start implementation
4. Agent updates Status when done

- **GitHub Issue closure** (post-merge finalizer — see `AGENTS.md` for full policy):
  - If the feature has a `GH: #N` in Notes, close the GitHub Issue only after:
    1. All acceptance criteria met and status is VERIFIED in this file.
    2. Implementation is merged to `main`.
    3. Closure comment posted with commit SHA and acceptance result.
  - Partial delivery: keep GitHub Issue open; use checklist or split follow-ups.
  - PRs use `Refs #N`, not `Fixes #N` (prevents premature auto-close).

## Statuses

- `TODO` — not started
- `PLANNED` — plan complete (problem, scope, edge cases, tests, acceptance criteria), ready to implement
- `IN PROGRESS` — being worked on
- `DONE` — implemented; correctness not yet verified end-to-end
- `VERIFIED` — covered by an automated end-to-end test or an explicit on-device manual verification log
- `DEFERRED` — postponed to a later milestone
- `WONT DO` — out of scope or rejected

## Plan Template

Before setting a feature to `PLANNED`, fill in these fields in a sub-section under the feature table (e.g., `### Feature #1 — Plan`):

- **Problem**: What user need does this address?
- **Scope**: What is included and excluded?
- **Edge cases**: Empty input, nil, boundary values, concurrent access, audio-session interruptions, network failures, language-pair specifics.
- **Test plan**: What tests will verify the feature?
- **Acceptance criteria**: How do we know it's done?
